# Gradient Boosted Neural Network-Multi-Output

Gradient Boosted Neural Network-Multi-Output or GBNN-MO model is a novel training procedure for shallow and deep neural networks. The GBNN-MO is specifically developed for single and multi-output regression problems. The GBNN-MO is developed over the [GBNN](https://github.com/GAA-UAM/GBNN) model.
