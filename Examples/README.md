# Example

This package contains the related experiments to the results of the paper. The comparison had done between two proposed GBNNN-Multioutput and GBNN-SingleOutput and neural networks.
We considered more than 18 datasets for these experiments, and you can access the dataset from the corresponding directory.

# Multioutput

This folder contains the implementation of the Multioutput experiments with the GBNN-MO and NN model.
It illustrates one dataset as an example. You can expand it for all the used datasets.

# Singleoutput
This folder contains the implementation of the Multioutput experiments with the GBNN-SO.
It illustrates one dataset as an example. You can expand it for all the used datasets.
## Dataset

This directory contains the example of using 17 multioutput regression datasets. I considered MTR datasets for the experiments. The path to clone the dataset and the number of features and missing values are included. The approaches to deal with the missing values are also mentioned in the txt file.
